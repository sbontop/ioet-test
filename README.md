# Overview
Combinations traversal to calculate employee's attendance coincidence 

# Architecture
The architecture consists of several text files to populate the data that later on is preprocessed and clean to abstract it on objects to easily manipulate data attributes and apply several filters and come up with a processed solution

# Approach and Methodology
Naive Approach: Traverse through all possible hour and minutes combinations from employees to perform validations filters, run several validation tests to provide a robust, reliable and optimal solution

## Setup
Previously installed Pythonv 3.5
- cd ioet-test/
- python main.py # to run main app
- python test.py # to perform tests
